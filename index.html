<p id=Bio style="display:none">I was born in New York City and lived there until I moved to Rochester with my family three years ago. I am half Puerto Rican and half Dominican. I train at the Bedroc gym three times a week participating in Brazilian Jujitsu and self defense. On Tuesday during the school year I practice archery with The Points to the Cross group. I am also one of the leaders on my school's robotics team. I currently attend Brighton Highschool and I will be a junior this year. I love to travel around the world with my family. I have traveled internationally to places such as Finland, Estonia, and the Dominican Republic. My family and I have also traveled domestically in the Untited States. I live with my older brother and two younger brothers, aswell as our two dogs Hunter and Jackson. I am afraid of hieghts, spiders, and i hate scary movies.
